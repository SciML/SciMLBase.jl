# Frequently Asked Questions

## What are the code styling rules for SciML?

All SciML libraries are supposed to follow [SciMLStyle](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLStyle/stable/).
Any deviation from that style is something to be fixed.

## Where do I find more information on the internals of some packages?

The [SciML Developer Documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDevDocs/stable/) describes the internals
of some of the larger solver libraries at length.

## What are the community practices that SciML developers should use?

See [ColPrac: Contributor's Guide on Collaborative Practices for Community Packages](https://docs.sciml.ai/ColPrac/stable/)

## Are there developer programs to help fund parties interested in helping develop SciML?

Yes! See [the SciML Developer Programs](https://sciml.ai/dev/) webpage.
