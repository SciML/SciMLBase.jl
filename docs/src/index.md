# The SciML Common Interface for Julia Equation Solvers

The SciML common interface ties together the numerical solvers of the Julia
package ecosystem into a single unified interface. It is designed for maximal
efficiency and parallelism, while incorporating essential features for large-scale
scientific machine learning such as differentiability, composability, and sparsity.

This documentation is made to pool together the docs of the various SciML libraries
to paint the overarching picture, establish development norms, and document the
shared/common functionality.

## Domains of SciML

The SciML common interface covers the following domains:

- Linear systems (`LinearProblem`)
  - Direct methods for dense and sparse
  - Iterative solvers with preconditioning
- Nonlinear Systems (`NonlinearProblem`)
  - Systems of nonlinear equations
  - Scalar bracketing systems
- Integrals (quadrature) (`IntegralProblem`)
- Differential Equations
  - Discrete equations (function maps, discrete stochastic (Gillespie/Markov)
    simulations) (`DiscreteProblem`)
  - Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (`ODEProblem`)
  - Split and Partitioned ODEs (Symplectic integrators, IMEX Methods) (`SplitODEProblem`)
  - Stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs or SDEs) (`SDEProblem`)
  - Stochastic differential-algebraic equations (SDAEs) (`SDEProblem` with mass matrices)
  - Random differential equations (RODEs or RDEs) (`RODEProblem`)
  - Differential algebraic equations (DAEs) (`DAEProblem` and `ODEProblem` with mass matrices)
  - Delay differential equations (DDEs) (`DDEProblem`)
  - Neutral, retarded, and algebraic delay differential equations (NDDEs, RDDEs, and DDAEs)
  - Stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) (`SDDEProblem`)
  - Experimental support for stochastic neutral, retarded, and algebraic delay differential equations (SNDDEs, SRDDEs, and SDDAEs)
  - Mixed discrete and continuous equations (Hybrid Equations, Jump Diffusions) (`AbstractDEProblem`s with callbacks)
- Optimization (`OptimizationProblem`)
  - Nonlinear (constrained) optimization
- (Stochastic/Delay/Differential-Algebraic) Partial Differential Equations (`PDESystem`)
  - Finite difference and finite volume methods
  - Interfaces to finite element methods
  - Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
  - Integro-Differential Equations
  - Fractional Differential Equations

The SciML common interface also includes
[ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/)
for defining such systems symbolically, allowing for optimizations like automated
generation of parallel code, symbolic simplification, and generation of sparsity
patterns.

## Extended SciML Domain

In addition to the purely numerical representations of mathematical objects, there are also
sets of problem types associated with common mathematical algorithms. These are:

- Data-driven modeling
  - Discrete-time data-driven dynamical systems (`DiscreteDataDrivenProblem`)
  - Continuous-time data-driven dynamical systems (`ContinuousDataDrivenProblem`)
  - Symbolic regression (`DirectDataDrivenProblem`)
- Uncertainty quantification and expected values (`ExpectationProblem`)

## Inverse Problems, Parameter Estimation, and Structural Identification

We note that parameter estimation and inverse problems are solved directly on their
constituent problem types using tools like [DiffEqFlux.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqFlux/stable/).
Thus for example, there is no `ODEInverseProblem`, and instead `ODEProblem` is used to
find the parameters `p` that solve the inverse problem.

## Common Interface High Level

The SciML interface is common as the usage of arguments is standardized across
all of the problem domains. Underlying high level ideas include:

- All domains use the same interface of defining a `AbstractSciMLProblem` which is then
  solved via `solve(prob,alg;kwargs)`, where `alg` is a `AbstractSciMLAlgorithm`. The
  keyword argument namings are standardized across the organization.
- `AbstractSciMLProblem`s are generally defined by a `SciMLFunction` which can define
  extra details about a model function, such as its analytical Jacobian, its
  sparsity patterns and so on.
- There is an organization-wide method for defining linear and nonlinear solvers
  used within other solvers, giving maximum control of performance to the user.
- Types used within the packages are defined by the input types. For example,
  packages attempt to internally use the type of the initial condition as the
  type for the state within differential equation solvers.
- `solve` calls should be thread-safe and parallel-safe.
- `init(prob,alg;kwargs)` returns an iterator which allows for directly iterating
  over the solution process
- High performance is key. Any performance that is not at the top level is considered
  a bug and should be reported as such.
- All functions have an in-place and out-of-place form, where the in-place form
  is made to utilize mutation for high performance on large-scale problems and
  the out-of-place form is for compatibility with tooling like static arrays and
  some reverse-mode automatic differentiation systems.
