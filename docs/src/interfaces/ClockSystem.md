# Clock and Timing System

SciMLBase provides a sophisticated clock and timing system for discrete-time models, hybrid systems, and event-driven simulations. This system enables precise control over when events occur and how different time domains interact within complex models.

## Overview

The clock system is designed to handle:
- Discrete-time models with regular sampling
- Event-driven systems with irregular timing
- Hybrid continuous-discrete systems
- Multi-rate systems with different time scales
- Scheduled events and periodic triggers

## Abstract Clock Types

### Core Abstractions

```julia
abstract type TimeDomain end
abstract type Clocks end
```

These form the foundation of the clock system:
- `TimeDomain`: Represents different types of time domains (continuous, discrete, etc.)
- `Clocks`: Base type for all clock implementations

## Concrete Clock Types

### ContinuousClock

```julia
ContinuousClock()
```

Represents continuous time domains where events can occur at any real-valued time instant. This is the default for continuous differential equations.

### PeriodicClock

```julia
PeriodicClock(period)
```

Creates a clock that triggers at regular intervals.

**Arguments:**
- `period`: The time interval between clock ticks

**Use Cases:**
- Discrete-time control systems
- Regular sampling of continuous signals
- Periodic boundary conditions

### SolverStepClock

```julia
SolverStepClock()
```

A clock that triggers at every solver step. This is useful for monitoring solver progress or implementing step-dependent logic.

### EventClock

```julia
EventClock(condition, affect!)
```

A clock that triggers when a specified condition is met.

**Arguments:**
- `condition`: Function that returns true when the event should trigger
- `affect!`: Function to execute when the event occurs

**Use Cases:**
- State-dependent events
- Threshold crossing detection
- Condition-based state changes

## Clock Properties and Traits

### Time Domain Classification

```julia
is_discrete_time_domain(clock)
iscontinuous(clock)
```

- `is_discrete_time_domain`: Returns `true` if the clock operates in discrete time
- `iscontinuous`: Returns `true` if the clock operates in continuous time

### Clock Type Checking

```julia
isclock(obj)
issolverstepclock(clock)
```

- `isclock`: Returns `true` if the object is a valid clock
- `issolverstepclock`: Returns `true` if the clock triggers on solver steps

## Indexed Clock System

### IndexedClock

```julia
IndexedClock(base_clock, index)
```

Wraps a base clock with an index for use in multi-clock systems.

**Arguments:**
- `base_clock`: The underlying clock
- `index`: Unique identifier for this clock instance

### Clock Canonicalization

```julia
canonicalize_indexed_clock(clock)
```

Converts clocks to their canonical indexed form for consistent internal representation.

## Usage Patterns

### Simple Periodic Sampling

```julia
using SciMLBase

# Create a periodic clock with 0.1 time unit intervals
clock = PeriodicClock(0.1)

# Use in a discrete problem
function discrete_update!(u, p, t, clock)
    if isclock(clock) && is_discrete_time_domain(clock)
        u[1] = u[1] * 0.9  # Decay
        u[2] = u[2] + sin(t)  # Periodic forcing
    end
end
```

### Event-Driven Systems

```julia
# Create an event clock that triggers when x > 1.0
event_condition(u, t, integrator) = u[1] - 1.0
event_affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[1] = 0.0

event_clock = EventClock(event_condition, event_affect!)

# Use with hybrid systems
```

### Multi-Rate Systems

```julia
# Different clocks for different subsystems
fast_clock = PeriodicClock(0.01)    # Fast dynamics
slow_clock = PeriodicClock(0.1)     # Slow dynamics
event_clock = EventClock(condition, affect!)  # Event-driven

# Indexed for system identification
clocks = [
    IndexedClock(fast_clock, 1),
    IndexedClock(slow_clock, 2),
    IndexedClock(event_clock, 3)
]
```

### Solver Step Monitoring

```julia
# Monitor every solver step
step_clock = SolverStepClock()

function monitor_steps(integrator)
    if issolverstepclock(step_clock)
        println("Step: $(integrator.step), Time: $(integrator.t)")
        # Log solution values, check convergence, etc.
    end
end
```

## Integration with Problem Types

### Discrete Problems

```julia
using SciMLBase

function discrete_dynamics!(u_next, u, p, t, clock)
    # Clock-dependent discrete update
    if is_discrete_time_domain(clock)
        u_next[1] = p[1] * u[1] + p[2] * u[2]
        u_next[2] = p[3] * u[1] + p[4] * u[2]
    end
end

# Problem with explicit clock
prob = DiscreteProblem(discrete_dynamics!, u0, tspan, p, 
                      clock = PeriodicClock(0.1))
```

### Hybrid Systems

```julia
# Continuous dynamics with discrete events
function hybrid_dynamics!(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = -u[1] + u[2]  # Continuous part
    du[2] = -2*u[2] + u[1]
end

# Event clock for state jumps
jump_condition(u, t, integrator) = u[1] - 2.0
jump_affect!(integrator) = integrator.u[2] += 1.0

hybrid_clock = EventClock(jump_condition, jump_affect!)
```

## Advanced Features

### Clock Synchronization

```julia
# Synchronize multiple clocks
function synchronize_clocks(clocks)
    canonical_clocks = [canonicalize_indexed_clock(c) for c in clocks]
    # Implementation depends on specific synchronization requirements
    return canonical_clocks
end
```

### Dynamic Clock Modification

```julia
# Dynamically change clock periods
mutable struct AdaptiveClock <: Clocks
    base_period::Float64
    current_period::Float64
    adaptation_rule::Function
end

function update_clock!(clock::AdaptiveClock, system_state)
    clock.current_period = clock.adaptation_rule(system_state)
end
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Clock Overhead**: Frequent clock checks can impact performance; use appropriate clock types for your application
- **Event Detection**: Event clocks require root-finding which can be computationally expensive
- **Memory Usage**: Multiple clocks in large systems should be managed efficiently
- **Synchronization**: Multi-clock systems may require careful synchronization for deterministic behavior

## Best Practices

1. **Choose Appropriate Clock Types**: Use `PeriodicClock` for regular sampling, `EventClock` for condition-based events
2. **Minimize Clock Frequency**: Higher frequency clocks increase computational overhead
3. **Index Clocks**: Use `IndexedClock` for systems with multiple clock domains
4. **Test Clock Logic**: Verify clock behavior with simple test cases before complex integration
5. **Monitor Performance**: Profile clock-dependent systems to ensure acceptable performance

The clock system provides powerful tools for modeling complex temporal behavior in scientific simulations while maintaining the performance and reliability expected from the SciML ecosystem.
