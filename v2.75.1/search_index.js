AutoSpecialize works by applying a function wrap just-in-time before the solve process to disable just-in-time re-specialization of the solver to the specific choice of model f and thus allow for using a cached solver compilation from a different f. This wrapping process can lead to a small decreased runtime performance with a benefit of a greatly decreased compile-time.\n\nNote About Benchmarking and Runtime Optimality\n\nIt is recommended that AutoSpecialize is not used in any benchmarking due to the potential effect of function wrapping on runtimes. AutoSpecialize's use case is targeted at decreased latency for REPL performance and not for cases where where top runtime performance is required (such as in optimization loops). Generally, for non-stiff equations the cost will be minimal and potentially not even measurable. For stiff equations, function wrapping has the limitation that only chunk sized 1 Dual numbers are allowed, which can decrease Jacobian construction performance.\n\nLimitations of AutoSpecialize\n\nThe following limitations are not fundamental to the implementation of AutoSpecialize, but are instead chosen as a compromise between default precompilation times and ease of maintenance. Please open an issue to discuss lifting any potential limitations.\n\nAutoSpecialize is only setup to wrap the functions from in-place ODEs. Other cases are excluded for the time being due to time limitations.\nAutoSpecialize will only lead to compilation reuse if the ODEFunction's other functions (such as jac and tgrad) are the default nothing. These could be JIT wrapped as well in a future version.\nAutoSpecialize'd functions are only compatible with Jacobian calculations performed with chunk size 1, and only with tag DiffEqBase.OrdinaryDiffEqTag(). Thus ODE solvers written on the common interface must be careful to detect the AutoSpecialize case and perform differentiation under these constraints, use finite differencing, or manually unwrap before solving. This will lead to decreased runtime performance for sufficiently large Jacobians.\nAutoSpecialize only wraps on Julia v1.8 and higher.\nAutoSpecialize does not handle cases with units. If unitful values are detected, wrapping is automatically disabled.\nAutoSpecialize only wraps cases for which promote_rule is defined between u0 and dual numbers, u0 and t, and for which ArrayInterface.promote_eltype is defined on u0 to dual numbers.\nAutoSpecialize only wraps cases for which f.mass_matrix isa UniformScaling, the default.\nAutoSpecialize does not wrap cases where f isa AbstractSciMLOperator\nBy default, only the u0 isa Vector{Float64}, eltype(tspan) isa Float64, and typeof(p) isa Union{Vector{Float64},SciMLBase.NullParameters} are specialized by the solver libraries. Other forms can be specialized with AutoSpecialize, but must be done in the precompilation of downstream libraries.\nAutoSpecialized functions are manually unwrapped in adjoint methods in SciMLSensitivity.jl in order to allow compiler support for automatic differentiation. Improved versions of adjoints which decrease the recompilation surface will come in non-breaking updates.\n\nCases where automatic wrapping is disabled are equivalent to FullSpecialize.\n\nExample\n\nf(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)\n\n# Note this is the same as ODEProblem(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))\n# If no preferences are set\nODEProblem{true, SciMLBase.AutoSpecialize}(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"interfaces/Problems/#SciMLBase.NoSpecialize","page":"SciMLProblems","title":"SciMLBase.NoSpecialize","text":"struct NoSpecialize <: SciMLBase.AbstractSpecialization\n\nNoSpecialize forces SciMLFunctions to not specialize on the types of functions wrapped within it. This ultimately contributes to a form such that every prob.f type is the same, meaning compilation caches are fully reused, with the downside of losing runtime performance. NoSpecialize is the form that most fully trades off runtime for compile time. Unlike AutoSpecialize, NoSpecialize can be used with any SciMLFunction.\n\nExample\n\nf(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)\nODEProblem{true, SciMLBase.NoSpecialize}(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"interfaces/Problems/#SciMLBase.FunctionWrapperSpecialize","page":"SciMLProblems","title":"SciMLBase.FunctionWrapperSpecialize","text":"struct FunctionWrapperSpecialize <: SciMLBase.AbstractSpecialization\n\nFunctionWrapperSpecialize is an eager wrapping choice which performs a function wrapping during the ODEProblem construction. This performs the function wrapping at the earliest possible point, giving the best compile-time vs runtime performance, but with the difficulty that any usage of prob.f needs to account for the function wrapper's presence. While optimal in a performance sense, this method has many usability issues with nonstandard solvers and analyses as it requires unwrapping before re-wrapping for any type changes. Thus this method is not used by default. Given that the compile-time different is almost undetectable from AutoSpecialize, this method is mostly used as a benchmarking reference for speed of light for AutoSpecialize.\n\nLimitations of FunctionWrapperSpecialize\n\nFunctionWrapperSpecialize has all of the limitations of AutoSpecialize, but also includes the limitations:\n\nprob.f is directly specialized to the types of (u,p,t), and any usage of prob.f on other types first requires using SciMLBase.unwrapped_f(prob.f) to remove the function wrapper.\nFunctionWrapperSpecialize can only be used by the ODEProblem constructor. If an ODEFunction is being constructed, the user must manually use DiffEqBase.wrap_iip on f before calling ODEFunction{true,FunctionWrapperSpecialize}(f).

When it gets sufficiently small, dtmin, an exit is thrown as the solution is likely unstable. dtmin is also chosen to be around the value where floating point issues cause t + dt == t, and thus a dt of that size is impossible at floating point precision.\nAnother common reason for this return code is if domain constraints are set, such as by using isoutofdomain, but the domain constraint is incorrect. For example, if one is solving the ODE f(u,p,t) = -u - 1, one may think \"but I want a solution with u > 0 and thus I will set isoutofdomain(u,p,t) = u < 0. However, the true solution of this ODE is not positive, and thus what will occur is that the solver will try to decrease dt until it can give an accurate solution that is positive.

Default is save_everystep && !isempty(saveat) for algorithms which have the ability to produce dense output, i.e. by default it's true unless the user has turned off saving on steps or has chosen a saveat value. If dense=false, the solution still acts like a function, and sol(t) is a linear interpolation between the saved time points.\nsaveat: Denotes specific times to save the solution at, during the solving phase. The solver will save at each of the timepoints in this array in the most efficient manner available to the solver. If only saveat is given, then the arguments save_everystep and dense are false by default. If saveat is given a number, then it will automatically expand to tspan[1]:saveat:tspan[2]. For methods where interpolation is not possible, saveat may be equivalent to tstops. The default value is [].\nsave_idxs: Denotes the indices for the components of the equation to save. Defaults to saving all indices. For example, if you are solving a 3-dimensional ODE, and given save_idxs = [1, 3], only the first and third components of the solution will be outputted. Notice that of course in this case the outputted solution will be two-dimensional.\ntstops: Denotes extra times that the timestepping algorithm must step to. This should be used to help the solver deal with discontinuities and singularities, since stepping exactly at the time of the discontinuity will improve accuracy. If a method cannot change timesteps (fixed timestep multistep methods), then tstops will use an interpolation, matching the behavior of saveat. If a method cannot change timesteps and also cannot interpolate, then tstops must be a multiple of dt or else an error will be thrown. Default is [].\nd_discontinuities: Denotes locations of discontinuities in low order derivatives. This will force FSAL algorithms which assume derivative continuity to re-evaluate the derivatives at the point of discontinuity. The default is [].\nsave_everystep: Saves the result at every step. Default is true if isempty(saveat).\nsave_on: Denotes whether intermediate solutions are saved. This overrides the settings of dense, saveat and save_everystep and is used by some applications to manually turn off saving temporarily. Everyday use of the solvers should leave this unchanged. Defaults to true.\nsave_start: Denotes whether the initial condition should be included in the solution type as the first timepoint.
