The default specialization level for problem functions. `AutoSpecialize`
works by applying a function wrap just-in-time before the solve process
to disable just-in-time re-specialization of the solver to the specific
choice of model `f` and thus allow for using a cached solver compilation
from a different `f`. This wrapping process can lead to a small decreased
runtime performance with a benefit of a greatly decreased compile-time.

## Note About Benchmarking and Runtime Optimality

It is recommended that `AutoSpecialize` is not used in any benchmarking
due to the potential effect of function wrapping on runtimes. `AutoSpecialize`'s
use case is targeted at decreased latency for REPL performance and
not for cases where where top runtime performance is required (such as in
optimization loops). Generally, for non-stiff equations the cost will be minimal
and potentially not even measurable. For stiff equations, function wrapping
has the limitation that only chunk sized 1 Dual numbers are allowed, which
can decrease Jacobian construction performance.

## Limitations of `AutoSpecialize`

The following limitations are not fundamental to the implementation of `AutoSpecialize`,
but are instead chosen as a compromise between default precompilation times and
ease of maintenance. Please open an issue to discuss lifting any potential
limitations.

* `AutoSpecialize` is only setup to wrap the functions from in-place ODEs. Other
  cases are excluded for the time being due to time limitations.
* `AutoSpecialize` will only lead to compilation reuse if the ODEFunction's other
  functions (such as jac and tgrad) are the default `nothing`. These could be
  JIT wrapped as well in a future version.
* `AutoSpecialize`'d functions are only compatible with Jacobian calculations
  performed with chunk size 1, and only with tag `DiffEqBase.OrdinaryDiffEqTag()`.
  Thus ODE solvers written on the common interface must be careful to detect
  the `AutoSpecialize` case and perform differentiation under these constraints,
  use finite differencing, or manually unwrap before solving. This will lead
  to decreased runtime performance for sufficiently large Jacobians.
* `AutoSpecialize` only wraps on Julia v1.8 and higher.
* `AutoSpecialize` does not handle cases with units. If unitful values are detected,
  wrapping is automatically disabled.
* `AutoSpecialize` only wraps cases for which `promote_rule` is defined between `u0`
  and dual numbers, `u0` and `t`, and for which `ArrayInterface.promote_eltype`
  is defined on `u0` to dual numbers.
* `AutoSpecialize` only wraps cases for which `f.mass_matrix isa UniformScaling`, the
  default.
* `AutoSpecialize` does not wrap cases where `f isa AbstractSciMLOperator`
* By default, only the `u0 isa Vector{Float64}`, `eltype(tspan) isa Float64`, and
  `typeof(p) isa Union{Vector{Float64},SciMLBase.NullParameters}` are specialized
  by the solver libraries. Other forms can be specialized with
  `AutoSpecialize`, but must be done in the precompilation of downstream libraries.
* `AutoSpecialize`d functions are manually unwrapped in adjoint methods in
  SciMLSensitivity.jl in order to allow compiler support for automatic differentiation.
  Improved versions of adjoints which decrease the recompilation surface will come
  in non-breaking updates.

Cases where automatic wrapping is disabled are equivalent to `FullSpecialize`.

## Example

```
f(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)

# Note this is the same as ODEProblem(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))
# If no preferences are set
ODEProblem{true, SciMLBase.AutoSpecialize}(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))
```
"""
struct AutoSpecialize <: AbstractSpecialization end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

`NoSpecialize` forces SciMLFunctions to not specialize on the types
of functions wrapped within it. This ultimately contributes to a
form such that every `prob.f` type is the same, meaning compilation
caches are fully reused, with the downside of losing runtime performance.
`NoSpecialize` is the form that most fully trades off runtime for compile
time. Unlike `AutoSpecialize`, `NoSpecialize` can be used with any
`SciMLFunction`.

## Example

```
f(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)
ODEProblem{true, SciMLBase.NoSpecialize}(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))
```
"""
struct NoSpecialize <: AbstractSpecialization end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

`FunctionWrapperSpecialize` is an eager wrapping choice which
performs a function wrapping during the `ODEProblem` construction.
This performs the function wrapping at the earliest possible point,
giving the best compile-time vs runtime performance, but with the
difficulty that any usage of `prob.f` needs to account for the
function wrapper's presence. While optimal in a performance sense,
this method has many usability issues with nonstandard solvers
and analyses as it requires unwrapping before re-wrapping for any
type changes. Thus this method is not used by default. Given that
the compile-time different is almost undetectable from AutoSpecialize,
this method is mostly used as a benchmarking reference for speed
of light for `AutoSpecialize`.

## Limitations of `FunctionWrapperSpecialize`

`FunctionWrapperSpecialize` has all of the limitations of `AutoSpecialize`,
but also includes the limitations:

* `prob.f` is directly specialized to the types of `(u,p,t)`, and any usage
  of `prob.f` on other types first requires using
  `SciMLBase.unwrapped_f(prob.f)` to remove the function wrapper.
* `FunctionWrapperSpecialize` can only be used by the `ODEProblem` constructor.
  If an `ODEFunction` is being constructed, the user must manually use
  `DiffEqBase.wrap_iip` on `f` before calling
  `ODEFunction{true,FunctionWrapperSpecialize}(f)`. This is a fundamental
  limitation of the approach as the types of `(u,p,t)` are required in the
  construction process and not accessible in the `AbstactSciMLFunction` constructors.

## Example

```
f(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)
ODEProblem{true, SciMLBase.FunctionWrapperSpecialize}(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))
```
"""
struct FunctionWrapperSpecialize <: AbstractSpecialization end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

`FullSpecialize` is an eager specialization choice which
directly types the `AbstractSciMLFunction` struct to match the type
of the model `f`. This forces recompilation of the solver on each
new function type `f`, leading to the most compile times with the
benefit of having the best runtime performance.

`FullSpecialize` should be used in all cases where top runtime performance
is required, such as in long-running simulations and benchmarking.

## Example

```
f(du,u,p,t) = (du .= u)
ODEProblem{true, SciMLBase.FullSpecialize}(f, [1.0], (0.0,1.0))

                           jac_prototype = __has_jac_prototype(f) ? f.jac_prototype : nothing,
                           sparsity = __has_sparsity(f) ? f.sparsity : jac_prototype,

                           sys = __has_sys(f) ? f.sys : nothing)
```

Note that only the function `f` itself is required. This function should
be given as `f!(du,u,p,t)` or `du = f(u,p,t)`. See the section on `iip`
for more details on in-place vs out-of-place handling.

All of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating
the usage of `f`. These include:

- `mass_matrix`: the mass matrix `M` represented in the ODE function. Can be used
  to determine that the equation is actually a differential-algebraic equation (DAE)
  if `M` is singular. Note that in this case special solvers are required, see the
  DAE solver page for more details: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/.
  Must be an AbstractArray or an AbstractSciMLOperator.
- `analytic(u0,p,t)`: used to pass an analytical solution function for the analytical
  solution of the ODE. Generally only used for testing and development of the solvers.
- `tgrad(dT,u,p,t)` or dT=tgrad(u,p,t): returns ``\frac{\partial f(u,p,t)}{\partial t}``
- `jac(J,u,p,t)` or `J=jac(u,p,t)`: returns ``\frac{df}{du}``
- `jvp(Jv,v,u,p,t)` or `Jv=jvp(v,u,p,t)`: returns the directional derivative``\frac{df}{du} v``
- `vjp(Jv,v,u,p,t)` or `Jv=vjp(v,u,p,t)`: returns the adjoint derivative``\frac{df}{du}^\ast v``
- `jac_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the Jacobian. For example,
  if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized `Tridiagonal` matrix can be used
  as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured
  sparsity patterns should use a `SparseMatrixCSC` with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense Jacobian.
- `paramjac(pJ,u,p,t)`: returns the parameter Jacobian ``\frac{df}{dp}``.
- `syms`: the symbol names for the elements of the equation. This should match `u0` in size. For
  example, if `u0 = [0.0,1.0]` and `syms = [:x, :y]`, this will apply a canonical naming to the
  values, allowing `sol[:x]` in the solution and automatically naming values in plots.
- `indepsym`: the canonical naming for the independent variable. Defaults to nothing, which
  internally uses `t` as the representation in any plots.
- `paramsyms`: the symbol names for the parameters of the equation. This should match `p` in
  size. For example, if `p = [0.0, 1.0]` and `paramsyms = [:a, :b]`, this will apply a canonical
  naming to the values, allowing `sol[:a]` in the solution.
- `colorvec`: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity
  pattern of the `jac_prototype`. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using
  finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner
  based on the sparsity pattern. Defaults to `nothing`, which means a color vector will be
  internally computed on demand when required. The cost of this operation is highly dependent
  on the sparsity pattern.

## iip: In-Place vs Out-Of-Place

`iip` is the optional boolean for determining whether a given function is written to
be used in-place or out-of-place. In-place functions are `f!(du,u,p,t)` where the return
is ignored, and the result is expected to be mutated into the value of `du`. Out-of-place
functions are `du=f(u,p,t)`.

Normally, this is determined automatically by looking at the method table for `f` and seeing
the maximum number of arguments in available dispatches. For this reason, the constructor
`ODEFunction(f)` generally works (but is type-unstable). However, for type-stability or
to enforce correctness, this option is passed via `ODEFunction{true}(f)`.

## specialize: Controlling Compilation and Specialization

The `specialize` parameter controls the specialization level of the ODEFunction
on the function `f`. This allows for a trade-off between compile and run time performance.
The available specialization levels are:

* `SciMLBase.AutoSpecialize`: this form performs a lazy function wrapping on the
  functions of the ODE in order to stop recompilation of the ODE solver, but allow
  for the `prob.f` to stay unwrapped for normal usage. This is the default specialization
  level and strikes a balance in compile time vs runtime performance.
* `SciMLBase.FullSpecialize`: this form fully specializes the `ODEFunction` on the
  constituent functions that make its fields. As such, each `ODEFunction` in this
  form is uniquely typed, requiring re-specialization and compilation for each new
  ODE definition. This form has the highest compile-time at the cost of being the
  most optimal in runtime. This form should be preferred for long-running calculations
  (such as within optimization loops) and for benchmarking.
* `SciMLBase.NoSpecialize`: this form fully unspecializes the function types in the ODEFunction
  definition by using an `Any` type declaration. As a result, it can result in reduced runtime
  performance, but is the form that induces the least compile-time.
* `SciMLBase.FunctionWrapperSpecialize`: this is an eager function wrapping form. It is
  unsafe with many solvers, and thus is mostly used for development testing.

For more details, see the
[specialization levels section of the SciMLBase documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/SciMLBase/stable/interfaces/Problems/#Specialization-Levels).

## Fields

The fields of the ODEFunction type directly match the names of the inputs.

## More Details on Jacobians

The following example creates an inplace `ODEFunction` whose Jacobian is a `Diagonal`:

```julia
using LinearAlgebra
f = (du,u,p,t) -> du .= t .* u
jac = (J,u,p,t) -> (J[1,1] = t; J[2,2] = t; J)
jp = Diagonal(zeros(2))
fun = ODEFunction(f; jac=jac, jac_prototype=jp)
```

Note that the integrators will always make a deep copy of `fun.jac_prototype`, so
there's no worry of aliasing.

In general, the Jacobian prototype can be anything that has `mul!` defined, in
particular sparse matrices or custom lazy types that support `mul!`. A special case
is when the `jac_prototype` is a `AbstractSciMLOperator`, in which case you
do not need to supply `jac` as it is automatically set to `update_coefficients!`.
Refer to the AbstractSciMLOperators documentation for more information
on setting up time/parameter dependent operators.

## Examples

### Declaring Explicit Jacobians for ODEs

The most standard case, declaring a function for a Jacobian is done by overloading
the function `f(du,u,p,t)` with an in-place updating function for the Jacobian:
`f_jac(J,u,p,t)` where the value type is used for dispatch. For example,
take the Lotka-Volterra model:

```julia
function f(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = 2.0 * u[1] - 1.2 * u[1]*u[2]
  du[2] = -3 * u[2] + u[1]*u[2]
end
```

To declare the Jacobian, we simply add the dispatch:

```julia
function f_jac(J,u,p,t)
  J[1,1] = 2.0 - 1.2 * u[2]
  J[1,2] = -1.2 * u[1]
  J[2,1] = 1 * u[2]
  J[2,2] = -3 + u[1]
  nothing
end
```

Then we can supply the Jacobian with our ODE as:

```julia
ff = ODEFunction(f;jac=f_jac)
```

and use this in an `ODEProblem`:

```julia
prob = ODEProblem(ff,ones(2),(0.0,10.0))
```

## Symbolically Generating the Functions

See the `modelingtoolkitize` function from
[ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) for
automatically symbolically generating the Jacobian and more from the
numerically-defined functions.

Note that only the functions `f_i` themselves are required. These functions should
be given as `f_i!(du,u,p,t)` or `du = f_i(u,p,t)`. See the section on `iip`
for more details on in-place vs out-of-place handling.

All of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating
the usage of the `SplitFunction`. These include:

- `mass_matrix`: the mass matrix `M` represented in the ODE function. Can be used

  if `M` is singular. Note that in this case special solvers are required, see the
  DAE solver page for more details: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/.
  Must be an AbstractArray or an AbstractSciMLOperator.
- `analytic(u0,p,t)`: used to pass an analytical solution function for the analytical
  solution of the ODE. Generally only used for testing and development of the solvers.
- `tgrad(dT,u,p,t)` or dT=tgrad(u,p,t): returns ``\frac{\partial f_1(u,p,t)}{\partial t}``
- `jac(J,u,p,t)` or `J=jac(u,p,t)`: returns ``\frac{df_1}{du}``
- `jvp(Jv,v,u,p,t)` or `Jv=jvp(v,u,p,t)`: returns the directional derivative``\frac{df_1}{du} v``
- `vjp(Jv,v,u,p,t)` or `Jv=vjp(v,u,p,t)`: returns the adjoint derivative``\frac{df_1}{du}^\ast v``
- `jac_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the Jacobian. For example,
  if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized `Tridiagonal` matrix can be used
  as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured
  sparsity patterns should use a `SparseMatrixCSC` with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense Jacobian.
- `paramjac(pJ,u,p,t)`: returns the parameter Jacobian ``\frac{df_1}{dp}``.
- `syms`: the symbol names for the elements of the equation. This should match `u0` in size. For
  example, if `u0 = [0.0,1.0]` and `syms = [:x, :y]`, this will apply a canonical naming to the
  values, allowing `sol[:x]` in the solution and automatically naming values in plots.
- `indepsym`: the canonical naming for the independent variable. Defaults to nothing, which
  internally uses `t` as the representation in any plots.
- `paramsyms`: the symbol names for the parameters of the equation. This should match `p` in
  size. For example, if `p = [0.0, 1.0]` and `paramsyms = [:a, :b]`, this will apply a canonical
  naming to the values, allowing `sol[:a]` in the solution.
- `colorvec`: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity
  pattern of the `jac_prototype`. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using
  finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner
  based on the sparsity pattern. Defaults to `nothing`, which means a color vector will be
  internally computed on demand when required. The cost of this operation is highly dependent
  on the sparsity pattern.

## Note on the Derivative Definition

The derivatives, such as the Jacobian, are only defined on the `f1` portion of the split ODE.
This is used to treat the `f1` implicit while keeping the `f2` portion explicit.

## Fields

The fields of the SplitFunction type directly match the names of the inputs.

## Symbolically Generating the Functions

See the `modelingtoolkitize` function from
[ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) for
automatically symbolically generating the Jacobian and more from the
numerically-defined functions. See `ModelingToolkit.SplitODEProblem` for
information on generating the SplitFunction from this symbolic engine.

Note that only the functions `f_i` themselves are required. These functions should
be given as `f_i!(du,u,p,t)` or `du = f_i(u,p,t)`. See the section on `iip`

All of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating
the usage of `f`. These include:

  to determine that the equation is actually a differential-algebraic equation (DAE)
  if `M` is singular. Note that in this case special solvers are required, see the
  DAE solver page for more details: https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/solvers/dae_solve/.
  Must be an AbstractArray or an AbstractSciMLOperator. Should be given as a tuple
  of mass matrices, i.e. `(M_1, M_2)` for the mass matrices of equations 1 and 2
  respectively.
- `analytic(u0,p,t)`: used to pass an analytical solution function for the analytical
  solution of the ODE. Generally only used for testing and development of the solvers.
- `tgrad(dT,u,p,t)` or dT=tgrad(u,p,t): returns ``\frac{\partial f(u,p,t)}{\partial t}``

- `vjp(Jv,v,u,p,t)` or `Jv=vjp(v,u,p,t)`: returns the adjoint derivative``\frac{df}{du}^\ast v``
- `jac_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the Jacobian. For example,
  if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized `Tridiagonal` matrix can be used
  as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured
  sparsity patterns should use a `SparseMatrixCSC` with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense Jacobian.
- `paramjac(pJ,u,p,t)`: returns the parameter Jacobian ``\frac{df}{dp}``.

- `paramjac(pJ,u,p,t)`: returns the parameter Jacobian ``\frac{df}{dp}``.
- `syms`: the symbol names for the elements of the equation. This should match `u0` in size. For

A representation of a RODE function `f`, defined by:

```math
M \frac{du}{dt} = f(u,p,t,W)dt
```

and all of its related functions, such as the Jacobian of `f`, its gradient
with respect to time, and more. For all cases, `u0` is the initial condition,

## Constructor

```julia

                           mass_matrix = __has_mass_matrix(f) ? f.mass_matrix : I,

                           paramjac = __has_paramjac(f) ? f.paramjac : nothing,
                           syms = __has_syms(f) ? f.syms : nothing,
                           indepsym= __has_indepsym(f) ? f.indepsym : nothing,

                           sys = __has_sys(f) ? f.sys : nothing,
                           analytic_full = __has_analytic_full(f) ? f.analytic_full : false)
```

Note that only the function `f` itself is required. This function should
be given as `f!(du,u,p,t,W)` or `du = f(u,p,t,W)`. See the section on `iip`
for more details on in-place vs out-of-place handling.

All of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating
the usage of `f`. These include:

- `mass_matrix`: the mass matrix `M` represented in the RODE function. Can be used
  to determine that the equation is actually a random differential-algebraic equation (RDAE)
  if `M` is singular.
- `analytic`: (u0,p,t,W)` or `analytic(sol)`: used to pass an analytical solution function for the analytical
  solution of the RODE. Generally only used for testing and development of the solvers.
  The exact form depends on the field `analytic_full`.
- `analytic_full`: a boolean to indicate whether to use the form `analytic(u0,p,t,W)` (if `false`)
  or the form `analytic!(sol)` (if `true`). The former is expected to return the solution `u(t)` of
  the equation, given the initial condition `u0`, the parameter `p`, the current time `t` and the
  value `W=W(t)` of the noise at the given time `t`. The latter case is useful when the solution
  of the RODE depends on the whole history of the noise, which is available in `sol.W.W`, at
  times `sol.W.t`. In this case, `analytic(sol)` must mutate explicitly the field `sol.u_analytic`
  with the corresponding expected solution at `sol.W.t` or `sol.t`.
- `tgrad(dT,u,p,t,W)` or dT=tgrad(u,p,t,W): returns ``\frac{\partial f(u,p,t,W)}{\partial t}``
- `jac(J,u,p,t,W)` or `J=jac(u,p,t,W)`: returns ``\frac{df}{du}``
- `jvp(Jv,v,u,p,t,W)` or `Jv=jvp(v,u,p,t,W)`: returns the directional derivative``\frac{df}{du} v``
- `vjp(Jv,v,u,p,t,W)` or `Jv=vjp(v,u,p,t,W)`: returns the adjoint derivative``\frac{df}{du}^\ast v``
- `jac_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the Jacobian. For example,
  if the Jacobian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized `Tridiagonal` matrix can be used
  as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured
  sparsity patterns should use a `SparseMatrixCSC` with a correct sparsity pattern for the Jacobian.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense Jacobian.
- `paramjac(pJ,u,p,t,W)`: returns the parameter Jacobian ``\frac{df}{dp}``.
- `syms`: the symbol names for the elements of the equation. This should match `u0` in size. For
  example, if `u0 = [0.0,1.0]` and `syms = [:x, :y]`, this will apply a canonical naming to the
  values, allowing `sol[:x]` in the solution and automatically naming values in plots.
- `indepsym`: the canonical naming for the independent variable. Defaults to nothing, which
  internally uses `t` as the representation in any plots.
- `paramsyms`: the symbol names for the parameters of the equation. This should match `p` in
  size. For example, if `p = [0.0, 1.0]` and `paramsyms = [:a, :b]`, this will apply a canonical
  naming to the values, allowing `sol[:a]` in the solution.
- `colorvec`: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity
  pattern of the `jac_prototype`. This specializes the Jacobian construction when using
  finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner
  based on the sparsity pattern. Defaults to `nothing`, which means a color vector will be
  internally computed on demand when required. The cost of this operation is highly dependent
  on the sparsity pattern.

## Examples


### Declaring Explicit Jacobians for DAEs

For fully implicit ODEs (`DAEProblem`s), a slightly different Jacobian function
is necessary. For the DAE

```math
G(du,u,p,t) = res
```

The Jacobian should be given in the form `gamma*dG/d(du) + dG/du ` where `gamma`
is given by the solver. This means that the signature is:

```julia
f(J,du,u,p,gamma,t)
```

For example, for the equation

```julia
function testjac(res,du,u,p,t)
  res[1] = du[1] - 2.0 * u[1] + 1.2 * u[1]*u[2]
  res[2] = du[2] -3 * u[2] - u[1]*u[2]
end
```

we would define the Jacobian as:

```julia
function testjac(J,du,u,p,gamma,t)
  J[1,1] = gamma - 2.0 + 1.2 * u[2]
  J[1,2] = 1.2 * u[1]
  J[2,1] = - 1 * u[2]
  J[2,2] = gamma - 3 - u[1]
  nothing
end
```

## Symbolically Generating the Functions

See the `modelingtoolkitize` function from
[ModelingToolkit.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/) for
automatically symbolically generating the Jacobian and more from the
numerically-defined functions.

    IntervalNonlinearFunction{iip, specialize, F, Ta, S, S2, O, SYS} <: AbstractIntervalNonlinearFunction{iip,specialize}

A representation of an interval nonlinear system of equations `f`, defined by:

```math
f(t,p) = u = 0
```

and all of its related functions. For all cases, `p` are the parameters and `t` is the
interval variable.

## Constructor

```julia
IntervalNonlinearFunction{iip, specialize}(f;
                           analytic = __has_analytic(f) ? f.analytic : nothing,
                           syms = __has_syms(f) ? f.syms : nothing,
                           paramsyms = __has_paramsyms(f) ? f.paramsyms : nothing,
                           sys = __has_sys(f) ? f.sys : nothing)
```

Note that only the function `f` itself is required. This function should
be given as `f!(u,t,p)` or `u = f(t,p)`. See the section on `iip`
for more details on in-place vs out-of-place handling.

All of the remaining functions are optional for improving or accelerating
the usage of `f`. These include:

- `analytic(p)`: used to pass an analytical solution function for the analytical
  solution of the ODE. Generally only used for testing and development of the solvers.
- `syms`: the symbol names for the elements of the equation. This should match `u0` in size. For
  example, if `u0 = [0.0,1.0]` and `syms = [:x, :y]`, this will apply a canonical naming to the
  values, allowing `sol[:x]` in the solution and automatically naming values in plots.
- `paramsyms`: the symbol names for the parameters of the equation. This should match `p` in
  size. For example, if `p = [0.0, 1.0]` and `paramsyms = [:a, :b]`, this will apply a canonical
  naming to the values, allowing `sol[:a]` in the solution.

## Positional Arguments

- `f(u,p)`: the function to optimize. `u` are the state variables and `p` are the hyperparameters of the optimization.
  This function should return a scalar.
- `adtype`: see the section "Defining Optimization Functions via AD"

## Keyword Arguments

- `grad(G,u,p)` or `G=grad(u,p)`: the gradient of `f` with respect to `u`
- `hess(H,u,p)` or `H=hess(u,p)`: the Hessian of `f` with respect to `u`
- `hv(Hv,u,v,p)` or `Hv=hv(u,v,p)`: the Hessian-vector product ``(d^2 f / du^2) v``.
- `cons(res,x,p)` or `cons(x,p)` : the constraints function, should mutate or return a vector
    with value of the `i`th constraint, evaluated at the current values of variables
    inside the optimization routine. This takes just the function evaluations
    and the equality or inequality assertion is applied by the solver based on the constraint
    bounds passed as `lcons` and `ucons` to [`OptimizationProblem`](@ref), in case of equality
    constraints `lcons` and `ucons` should be passed equal values.
- `cons_j(res,x,p)` or `res=cons_j(x,p)`: the Jacobian of the constraints.
- `cons_h(res,x,p)` or `res=cons_h(x,p)`: the Hessian of the constraints, provided as
   an array of Hessians, with `res[i]` being the Hessian with respect to the `i`th output on `cons`.
- `lag_h(res,x,sigma,mu,p)` or `res=lag_h(x,sigma,mu,p)`: the Hessian of the Lagrangian,
    where `sigma` is a multiplier of the cost function and `mu` are the Lagrange multipliers
    multiplying the constraints. This can be provided instead of `hess` and `cons_h`
    to solvers that directly use the Hessian of the Lagrangian.
- `paramjac(pJ,u,p)`: returns the parameter Jacobian ``df/dp``.
- `hess_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the Hessian. For example,
  if the Hessian is tridiagonal, then an appropriately sized `Hessian` matrix can be used
  as the prototype and integrators will specialize on this structure where possible. Non-structured
  sparsity patterns should use a `SparseMatrixCSC` with a correct sparsity pattern for the Hessian.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense Hessian.
- `cons_jac_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the constraint Jacobian.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense constraint Jacobian.
- `cons_hess_prototype`: a prototype matrix matching the type that matches the constraint Hessian.
  This is defined as an array of matrices, where `hess[i]` is the Hessian w.r.t. the `i`th output.
  For example, if the Hessian is sparse, then `hess` is a `Vector{SparseMatrixCSC}`.
  The default is `nothing`, which means a dense constraint Hessian.
- `syms`: the symbol names for the elements of the equation. This should match `u0` in size. For
  example, if `u = [0.0,1.0]` and `syms = [:x, :y]`, this will apply a canonical naming to the
  values, allowing `sol[:x]` in the solution and automatically naming values in plots.
- `paramsyms`: the symbol names for the parameters of the equation. This should match `p` in
  size. For example, if `p = [0.0, 1.0]` and `paramsyms = [:a, :b]`, this will apply a canonical
  naming to the values, allowing `sol[:a]` in the solution.
- `hess_colorvec`: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity
  pattern of the `hess_prototype`. This specializes the Hessian construction when using
  finite differences and automatic differentiation to be computed in an accelerated manner
  based on the sparsity pattern. Defaults to `nothing`, which means a color vector will be
  internally computed on demand when required. The cost of this operation is highly dependent
  on the sparsity pattern.
- `cons_jac_colorvec`: a color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for the sparsity
  pattern of the `cons_jac_prototype`.
- `cons_hess_colorvec`: an array of color vector according to the SparseDiffTools.jl definition for
  the sparsity pattern of the `cons_hess_prototype`.

## Defining Optimization Functions Via AD

While using the keyword arguments gives the user control over defining
all the possible functions, the simplest way to handle the generation
of an `OptimizationFunction` is by specifying an AD type. By doing so,
this will automatically fill in all the extra functions. For example,

```julia
OptimizationFunction(f,AutoZygote())
```

will use [Zygote.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Zygote.jl/stable/) to define
all of the necessary functions. Note that if any functions are defined
directly, the auto-AD definition does not overwrite the user's choice.

Each of the AD-based constructors are documented separately via their
own dispatches.

    IntegralFunction{iip,specialize,F,T} <: AbstractIntegralFunction{iip}

A representation of an integrand `f` defined by:

```math
f(u, p)
```

For an in-place form of `f` see the `iip` section below for details on in-place or
out-of-place handling.

```julia
IntegralFunction{iip,specialize}(f, [integrand_prototype])
```

Note that only `f` is required, and in the case of inplace integrands a mutable container
`integrand_prototype` to store the result of the integrand. If `integrand_prototype` is
present, `f` is interpreted as in-place, and otherwise `f` is assumed to be out-of-place.

## iip: In-Place vs Out-Of-Place

Out-of-place functions must be of the form ``y = f(u, p)`` and in-place functions of the form
``f(y, u, p)``. Since `f` is allowed to return any type (e.g. real or complex numbers or
arrays), in-place functions must provide a container `integrand_prototype` that is of the
right type for the variable ``y``, and the result is written to this container in-place.
When in-place forms are used, in-place array operations, i.e. broadcasting, may be used by
algorithms to reduce allocations. If `integrand_prototype` is not provided, `f` is assumed
to be out-of-place and quadrature is performed assuming immutable return types.

BatchIntegralFunction{iip,specialize,F,T} <: AbstractIntegralFunction{iip}

A representation of an integrand `f` that can be evaluated at multiple points simultaneously
using threads, the gpu, or distributed memory defined by:

```math
y = f(u, p)
```

``u`` is a vector whose elements correspond to distinct evaluation points to `f`, whose
output must be returned as an array whose last "batching" dimension corresponds to integrand
evaluations at the different points in ``u``. In general, the integration algorithm is
allowed to vary the number of evaluation points between subsequent calls to `f`.

For an in-place form of `f` see the `iip` section below for details on in-place or
out-of-place handling.

```julia
BatchIntegralFunction{iip,specialize}(f, [integrand_prototype];
                                     max_batch=typemax(Int))
```
Note that only `f` is required, and in the case of inplace integrands a mutable container
`integrand_prototype` to store the result of the integrand of one integrand, without a last
"batching" dimension.

The keyword `max_batch` is used to set a soft limit on the number of points to batch at the
same time so that memory usage is controlled.

If `integrand_prototype` is present, `f` is interpreted as in-place, and otherwise `f` is
assumed to be out-of-place.

## iip: In-Place vs Out-Of-Place

Out-of-place functions must be of the form ``y = f(u,p)`` and in-place functions of the form
``f(y, u, p)``. Since `f` is allowed to return any type (e.g. real or complex numbers or
arrays), in-place functions must provide a container `integrand_prototype` of the right type
for a single integrand evaluation. The integration algorithm will then allocate a ``y``
array with the same element type as `integrand_prototype` and an additional last "batching"
dimension to store multiple integrand evaluations. In the out-of-place case, the algorithm
may infer the type of ``y`` by passing `f` an empty array of input points. This means ``y``
is a vector in the out-of-place case, or a matrix/array in the in-place case. The number of
batched points may vary between subsequent calls to `f`. When in-place forms are used,
in-place array operations may be used by algorithms to reduce allocations. If
`integrand_prototype` is not provided, `f` is assumed to be out-of-place.
